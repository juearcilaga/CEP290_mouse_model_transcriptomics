# CEP290_mouse_model_transcriptomics
This repository contains scripts for analyzing bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from a mouse model of Joubert syndrome with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Cep290 gene. The scripts cover key steps in transcriptomic analysis, including quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, and visualization.
Rawcounts were normalized using the script 'cpm and PCA plot' and PCA plots were generated using the same script
Differential gene analysis were produced using the script 'Differential Expression Analysis & Volcano Plot' and Volcano plots (both with and without labels) were produced using the same script
GOBP stress associated gene sets were used to filter differential expression dataframes for significant stress genes using the script 'Stress Gene Definitions'
