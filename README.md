# CEP290_mouse_model_transcriptomics
This repository contains scripts for analyzing bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from a mouse model of Joubert syndrome with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Cep290 gene. The scripts cover key steps in transcriptomic analysis, including quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, and visualization.
